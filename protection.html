              <h1>Corrosion Protection and Conservation</h1>
              <p>
                Rowan Technologies has a wealth of experience in the protection and conservation of both historic and
                modern buildings both in the UK and further afield. We are advisers to English Heritage and have been
                involved in the conservation of many of the UK's most prominent historic buildings.
              </p>

              <h2>Cathodic Protection</h2>
              <p>
                Cathodic protection (CP) is a method of controlling corrosion in metals embedded in stone, concrete and
                masonry by suppressing the electrochemical corrosion reaction. One of the advantages of CP is that it
                can provide protection without changing the immediate physical environment of the structure. By its
                nature, CP provides the optimum electrochemical conditions for the material being protected, thus
                preserving the visual appearance of the structure.
              </p>

              <p>
                Rowan Technologies are experts in CP systems, having installed and maintained systems on a large number
                of prominent historic buildings and structures around the UK. We can provide custom designed systems for
                virtually any application, from the smallest monument to the largest cathedral. We can also supply
                systems for more modern buildings.
              </p>

              <h2>Concrete</h2>
              <p>
                Rowan Technologies have extensive experience of both historic and modern concrete structures. We offer a
                comprehensive concrete inspection and consultancy service ranging from testing carbonation depths to
                preparing and costing repair and conservation strategies.
              </p>

              <h2>Metal Roofs</h2>
              <p>
                With extensive experience of both contemporary and historic structures, Rowan Technologies provides a
                comprehensive specification, monitoring and inspection service for all types of metallic roofs (lead,
                stainless steel and copper). During collaborative research projects with English Heritage, a <a
                href="#patination" class="tabtrigger">chalk-rich coating (patination cream)</a> supplied by us has been
                developed for protecting the underside of lead roofs from corrosion.

              <h1>Cathodic Protection</h1>
              <p>
                The corrosion of embedded metalwork is becoming an increasing problem in our historic buildings and
                monuments. Even if the rate of corrosion is relatively low, in the long term it results in the
                fracturing of the surrounding stones and in severe cases the loss of structural integrity. This is due
                to the incredible expansion forces created by corrosion; the volume ratio between iron and rust can be
                as high as 1:7.
              </p>

              <p>
                Architects have, in the past, attempted to remove as much of the original iron fittings as possible and
                replace them with more corrosion resistant materials. The conservation policy now followed in the UK for
                heritage buildings is that of minimum intervention with the intention of retaining as much of the
                original structure as possible.
              </p>

              <p>
                Cathodic protection (CP) is a non-destructive method of controlling the corrosion of iron and steel
                embedded in stone, masonry or brick. It is the application of a small negative charge to the embedded
                metalwork, and is being used increasingly to control corrosion within historic buildings. In recent
                years, Rowan Technologies have used CP to protect concrete from steel reinforcement corrosion.
              </p>
              <p>There are two types of CP system:</p>

              <h2>Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection (SACP)</h2>
              <p>
                SACP systems use a sacrificial anode (a large piece of zinc or magnesium buried in the ground) which
                corrodes preferentially to the embedded metalwork. The sacrificial anode is placed in close proximity to
                the corroding metalwork and is electrically connected to it. As the sacrificial anode corrodes, it
                generates a current that passes through the building material to provide protection to the embedded
                metalwork.<br>
                <img src="img/diagrams/sacp_schematic.png" width="344" height="244" alt="Schematic for SACP">
              </p>

              <h2>Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP)</h2>
              <p>
                ICCP systems require an external power supply, normally using mains powered electronics to provide the
                DC current to the iron or steel to be protected.<br>
                <img src="img/diagrams/iccp_schematic.png" width="344" height="191" alt="Schematic for ICCP">
              </p>

              <p>
                One of CP’s main advantages is that it provides corrosion control without changing the immediate
                physical environment; there may still be now, or in the future, damp stone, masonry or concrete adjacent
                to the metal which would previously have allowed corrosion to continue. Cathodic protection provides the
                electrochemical conditions to control this corrosion process.
              </p>

              <p>
                The application of cathodic protection to historic structures is now becoming widely accepted as the
                process is fully reversible, cost effective and is in accordance with modern day conservation
                principles. Rowan Technologies are experts in the application of cathodic protection to historic
                buildings and monuments, and have installations in many well-known and listed structures.

              <h1>Concrete</h1>
              <p>
                Reinforced concrete was first used in the construction industry in the late 19th Century. Concrete is
                very strong in compression but relatively weak in tension. Steel reinforcements were therefore added to
                overcome this limitation. The reinforcements may consist of steel bars, meshes, rods and wires.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most early reinforced concrete structures now require some form of repair and conservation. The majority
                of damage that occurs to reinforced concrete structures is due to corrosion of the embedded steel
                reinforcements. As the steel corrodes, it can expand by up to a factor of 7, damaging the surrounding
                concrete.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before any repair or conservation plans can be formulated, it is essential that a comprehensive concrete
                assessment is carried out in order to fully understand the nature of the damage and the causes of
                deterioration. Rowan Technologies are specialists in concrete assessment, having inspected and reported
                on many historic and modern concrete structures.

              <h1>Chalk Enhanced Patination Cream</h1>
              <p>
                Rowan Technologies supplies a chalk-rich corrosion protection coating (Chalk Emulsion or Patination
                Cream) for the underside of lead roofing. This product was developed in collaboration with English
                Heritage and uses high-quality ICI/Dulux emulsion coatings. Extensively tested at a number of sites, it
                has been evaluated under severe corrosion conditions for over ten years.
              </p>

              <p>
                The chalk systems were originally developed for traditional non-ventilated roofs where corrosion has
                previously been found or where the risk of corrosion occurring is significant. It is also applicable to
                modern roofs where lead may be laid over man-made boards that have the potential to emit carboxylic
                acids if they become damp.
              </p>

              <p>
                The chalk emulsion is available in 5 litre containers. The coverage rate is between 22 to 26m&sup2; per
                container for a single layer. Orders can be placed by contacting Rowan Technologies directly.
              </p>
