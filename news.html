                <h2>Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL have just shipped another full thermal and corrosion scanner to South Korea. This is the sixth
                  scanner to be installed in this country and the second on this modern 'supercritical powered' station
                  that provides electricity for the capital, Seoul. The scanner comes complete with the latest
                  monitoring software and analysis package which sends on-line thermal and corrosion data to the plant
                  control room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A thermal only scanner extension has been supplied to Drax power station for their Unit 4 boiler. This
                  greatly increases the capability of the existing thermal scanner so that combustion conditions that
                  result in tube rupture can be successfully monitored and eventually overcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stand-alone non-intrusive heat flux and corrosion monitors are now in their final stage of
                  development. The first production boards are being produced and these should be ready for full testing
                  in a power station in September. These new computer controlled stand-alone monitoring systems have
                  application in many other areas apart from combustion systems, such as pipelines, vessels and
                  industrial plant where there is a risk from corrosion.

                <p>
                  RTL have recently completed the design and installation of cathodic protection systems to a church
                  tower in Shropshire and to 18th century muses at Seaton Delaval Hall – a National Trust property.  The
                  church bellcote contains a wrought iron ring beam embedded in the masonry and also iron cores to the
                  columns, all of which were corroding and cracking the historic stones.  Seaton Delaval Hall contains
                  six muses with wrought iron armatures, all of which have been suffering from ongoing corrosion which
                  had cracked and delaminated the plaster/lime bodies and limbs of the sculptures.  This is the first
                  time that RTL have applied cathodic protection to plaster and lime statues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL have been involved with the historic concrete Tecton buildings at Dudley Zoo for the past two
                  years.  These buildings are currently being repaired and conserved using techniques compiled by RTL
                  over the past 10 years.  A technical paper outlining the repair and conservation of historic concrete
                  has been submitted to the Journal of Architectural Conservation.

                  RTL has recently completed a contract to design, supply and install a full corrosion scanner on a
                  fifth South Korea coal-fired boiler - the third boiler to incorporate a scanner system at this
                  particular power station. The system monitors all four boiler walls and incorporates the latest on-
                  line data analysis software which gives both thermal and corrosion rate maps of the boiler walls. The
                  company has also received an order for another corrosion scanner on a Korean supercritical boiler
                  which will be delivered in April 2014. This system will be interfaced with water cannons to create an
                  intelligent wall cleaning system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has also received another order from Drax power station to design and install a corrosion
                  scanner on their Unit 3 boiler, which is being converted to fire biomass. This is due to be delivered
                  in February 2014.

                <p>
                  RTL's R&amp;D division has recently developed a stand-alone non-intrusive heat flux sensor that makes
                  use of combination of novel measurement techniques. These new low-cost systems are intended to compete
                  against the existing intrusive heat flux probes which are used to activate soot blower and water
                  cannon operations. These devices should be commercially available in spring 2014.

                  RTL have recently completed the design and installation of a cathodic protection system to protect
                  embedded steel beams in a large retail outlet in Lewisham, London. Four larger cathodic protection
                  systems are currently being installed at Lincoln Castle prison to protect the cast iron windows - a
                  Victorian museum which is being repaired and conserved to house Lincoln's copy of the Magna Carta (the
                  fourth version and the only one outside London).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has also completed an advisory project associated with the repair, cleaning and coating of
                  concrete surfaces at the Grade 2* listed Alexandra Road Estate, London. This work is part of a HLF
                  project scheduled to take place in 2014.

                <h2>Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL have recently completed a contract to supply a full corrosion scanner to the sidewalls of the Unit
                  6 boiler at Drax Power Station – the third Drax boiler to be fully instrumented with a corrosion
                  monitoring system installed on the sidewalls. The coal-fired boilers are increasingly having lower-
                  NOx systems installed which results in increasingly 'reducing conditions' within the combustion zones.
                  This can result in high levels of corrosion so careful control of the stoichiometry is essential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has now automated the corrosion rate analysis package and on-line corrosion rate, metal
                  loss and remaining thickness maps are continually being output from the data loggers. The thermal and
                  corrosion rate data is fed back to the OIS via a fibre optic link so that the boiler operators have
                  direct access to the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL have also installed a fast thermal scanner on a section of the back wall of the Unit 4 boiler.
                  This area has increasingly suffered from localised thermal tube damage which have resulted in
                  unscheduled outages. The non-intrusive sensors are used to give estimated fireside information (front
                  face temperatures and heat flux values) and this is allowing the engineers to investigate when (and
                  how) these transient conditions occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has recently been awarded another contract in Korea – to supply a full corrosion scanner
                  to the Unit 3 boiler at Samcheonpo Power Station. This is the third boiler to be fitted out at this
                  site.

                <h2>Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL successfully completed a corrosion monitoring programme during biofuel trials carried out on the
                  Unit 1 boiler at Drax Power station in 2011/12. The ground breaking work involved monitoring both the
                  corrosion of the carbon steel furnace walls and also localised attack of the austenitic stainless
                  steel used for the superheaters and reheaters of the 660MW boiler. The high level of alkaline metals
                  in some of the biofuels can result in substantial corrosion of stainless steels, and this was
                  confirmed when some of the worst fuels were combusted and corrosion rates recorded unacceptable
                  levels. The on-line monitoring allowed corrosion rates to be confirmed within around 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL has subsequently been asked to provide a complete monitoring package for the Unit 2 boiler which
                  will be converted to 100% biofuel firing in March 2013. The corrosion scanner system will be the
                  largest ever produced by the company and will take measurements for the full height of both sidewalls
                  and with four superheater probes in the convective section to monitor the corrosion of both T11 and
                  stainless steel Esshete 1250 alloy. The intention is that the boiler feed will initially be wood
                  pellets, but it is possible that more corrosive fuels, such as agro-crops, may be fired later on.  The
                  outputs, comprising corrosion rates, metal loss, remaining metal thickness and heat flux values will
                  be output to the DCS so that the boiler operators will have direct access to the information and can
                  then take appropriate actions on boiler feed and combustion operation.

                <p>
                  RTL have been appointed concrete consultants by the National Theatre, London, to advise on the
                  traditional repair of historic concrete. The Theatre is being substantially upgraded with a large
                  extension (NT future) in addition to ongoing repairs and RTL have been pioneering traditional repair
                  of this type.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL has also been involved with concrete conservation associated with the Grade 1 listed Tecton
                  buildings at Dudley Zoo and advisory work on the WW2 concrete assets at Kenley Common – one of the
                  main bases for the fighter planes which protected the UK during the Battle of Britain.

                <p>
                  Three of the latest versions of our non-intrusive thermal and corrosion scanner systems are currently being
                  installed on coal-fired power station boilers in South Korea. The latest scanner systems monitor both heat
                  flux and corrosion on all four walls of these large boilers with real-time outputs (2D maps) being sent
                  directly to the control rooms and also to the PI historian. The scanner will enable the power stations to
                  optimise their combustion conditions and also allow lower quality coal to be fired in the safe knowledge
                  that damage to the boilers is kept to a minimum.
