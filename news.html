                  Work is underway to upgrade a large corrosion and thermal scanner system installed on the sidewalls of
                  Unit 3 boiler at Drax Power Station, UK. The system, comprising 270 sensor locations, monitors both
                  fireside corrosion of the sidewall tubing and heat transfer through the tube walls. Drax is the UK's
                  largest power station with six 660 MW power generation units that operate using both coal and
                  biofuels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rowan Technologies currently has five large scanner systems installed on the boilers at Drax with a
                  combined total of 1200 sensor locations. Fifteen VTER air-cooled corrosion probes are also installed
                  to monitor corrosion of the superheater and reheater tubes at the top of the boilers.

                <p>
                  Rowan Technologies has now completed the design and installation of a cathodic protection system to
                  the second tower at Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge. The system protects the tie bars and cramps
                  embedded within the stonework at the top of the first tower.

                  The company is also involved with the specifications and methods for the repairs to the historic
                  concrete at both Hurst Castle and Covent Garden. We have recently been engaged to advise on the
                  repairs to the cast iron elements of the World Heritage Ironbridge. The brittle cast iron has suffered

                <h2>Thermal and Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL has recently commissioned a large scanner system, installed alongside new water cannons, for a
                  large supercritical power generation boiler at Yeungheung power plant, S. Korea. Yeungheung is a
                  modern generation plant with a total generation capacity of about 5GW and feeds power directly into
                  the country's capital Seoul. The scanner and water cannons form a complete feedback control cleaning
                  system for all four walls of the Unit 3 boiler. This is the second scanner system to be installed at
                  this plant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scanner system comprises four sensor arrays, one for each wall, with a total of about 190 sensor
                  locations. Thermal scans of all four walls are completed in around 100 seconds, providing real-time
                  information of tube wall heat flux and wall cleanliness to the cannon cleaning system and this
                  information determines when, where and how the tube wall surfaces are cleaned using the water cannons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As well as providing tube wall thermal data, this scanner is also configured to monitor fireside tube
                  wall corrosion. This achieved by interleaving thermal scans with resistance (i.e. corrosion-related)
                  measurements.

                <h2>Thermal and Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL have now released their <strong><a href="monitoring.html#tab_hfc">new Heat Flux and Corrosion (HFC) monitors</a></strong>.
                  These monitors use new measurement techniques developed from RTL's established electrical resistance
                  techniques. Electrical signals are applied through heat exchanger tube walls or heat transfer
                  surfaces, using external (cold-side) sensors, to provide a <strong>non-intrusive</strong> measurement
                  of heat flux. HFC monitors are significantly cheaper to install than currently available intrusive
                  heat flux monitors and do not require sensors to be welded into the fireside (hot-side) walls, with
                  all the risks that this process entails.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These systems also have inherent corrosion detection capability and can be used as stand-alone
                  corrosion monitors in their own right. HFC monitors are now available off-the-shelf to be installed
                  and operated directly by clients. Contact the company for further details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL now also produces a range of smaller scanner systems: these <strong><a href="pdf/brochure/mini_scanner_brochure.pdf" target="_blank">new 'mini-scanners'</a></strong>
                  have on-board computing power and operate from a single small enclosure. They are designed for
                  monitoring smaller, more localised areas of boiler wall with up to 50 or more sensor locations, as
                  compared to our larger scanner systems that can handle 500 or more sensor locations. They have similar
                  corrosion and thermal monitoring capabilities as the larger scanners and their compact, self-contained
                  design helps make installation a simple and straight-forward process.

                <h2>VTER Corrosion Monitoring Probes</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL have designed extended-length variable temperature electrical resistance (VTER) probes for the
                  on-line measurement of corrosion of reheater/superheater tubes in power stations. These probes have
                  the capability of operating two metres inside boilers using a protective ceramic bandage to minimise
                  the temperatures of the probe bodies. Two of these extended VTER probes have recently been installed
                  at Drax Power Station, UK, for the monitoring of 1% chrome tubing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL have now received an order to update the original corrosion scanner on Unit 1 at Drax power
                  station and to add a further four VTER superheater probes and an extended VTER reheater probe.

                  Rowan Technologies has recently completed four cathodic protection systems at Lincoln Castle;
                  installed to protect cast iron windows from ongoing corrosion. Lincoln's copy of the Magna Carta (one
                  of only four in existence) is due to be returned to the city in April and will be installed within the
                  castle. RTL has recently completed smaller investigative projects at Hurst Castle and in Hyde Park.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Concrete conservation projects have recently been completed at the Alexandra Road Estate, Camden and
                  at a pre-stressed concrete church in Sheldon, Birmingham. Both of these projects were HLF funded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has prepared two technical papers on cathodic protection and traditional repair of

                <p>
                  RTL have just shipped another full thermal and corrosion scanner to South Korea. This is the sixth
                  scanner to be installed in this country and the second on this modern 'supercritical powered' station
                  that provides electricity for the capital, Seoul. The scanner comes complete with the latest
                  monitoring software and analysis package which sends on-line thermal and corrosion data to the plant
                  control room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A thermal only scanner extension has been supplied to Drax power station for their Unit 4 boiler. This
                  greatly increases the capability of the existing thermal scanner so that combustion conditions that
                  result in tube rupture can be successfully monitored and eventually overcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stand-alone non-intrusive heat flux and corrosion monitors are now in their final stage of
                  development. The first production boards are being produced and these should be ready for full testing
                  in a power station in September. These new computer controlled stand-alone monitoring systems have
                  application in many other areas apart from combustion systems, such as pipelines, vessels and
                  industrial plant where there is a risk from corrosion.

                <p>
                  RTL have recently completed the design and installation of cathodic protection systems to a church
                  tower in Shropshire and to 18th century muses at Seaton Delaval Hall – a National Trust property.  The
                  church bellcote contains a wrought iron ring beam embedded in the masonry and also iron cores to the
                  columns, all of which were corroding and cracking the historic stones.  Seaton Delaval Hall contains
                  six muses with wrought iron armatures, all of which have been suffering from ongoing corrosion which
                  had cracked and delaminated the plaster/lime bodies and limbs of the sculptures.  This is the first
                  time that RTL have applied cathodic protection to plaster and lime statues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL have been involved with the historic concrete Tecton buildings at Dudley Zoo for the past two
                  years.  These buildings are currently being repaired and conserved using techniques compiled by RTL
                  over the past 10 years.  A technical paper outlining the repair and conservation of historic concrete
                  has been submitted to the Journal of Architectural Conservation.

                  RTL has recently completed a contract to design, supply and install a full corrosion scanner on a
                  fifth South Korea coal-fired boiler - the third boiler to incorporate a scanner system at this
                  particular power station. The system monitors all four boiler walls and incorporates the latest on-
                  line data analysis software which gives both thermal and corrosion rate maps of the boiler walls. The
                  company has also received an order for another corrosion scanner on a Korean supercritical boiler
                  which will be delivered in April 2014. This system will be interfaced with water cannons to create an
                  intelligent wall cleaning system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has also received another order from Drax power station to design and install a corrosion
                  scanner on their Unit 3 boiler, which is being converted to fire biomass. This is due to be delivered
                  in February 2014.

                <p>
                  RTL's R&amp;D division has recently developed a stand-alone non-intrusive heat flux sensor that makes
                  use of combination of novel measurement techniques. These new low-cost systems are intended to compete
                  against the existing intrusive heat flux probes which are used to activate soot blower and water
                  cannon operations. These devices should be commercially available in spring 2014.
