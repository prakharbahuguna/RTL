                  Work is underway to upgrade a large corrosion and thermal scanner system installed on the sidewalls of
                  Unit 3 boiler at Drax Power Station, UK. The system, comprising 270 sensor locations, monitors both
                  fireside corrosion of the sidewall tubing and heat transfer through the tube walls. Drax is the UK's
                  largest power station with six 660 MW power generation units that operate using both coal and
                  biofuels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rowan Technologies currently has five large scanner systems installed on the boilers at Drax with a
                  combined total of 1200 sensor locations. Fifteen VTER air-cooled corrosion probes are also installed
                  to monitor corrosion of the superheater and reheater tubes at the top of the boilers.

                <p>
                  Rowan Technologies has now completed the design and installation of a cathodic protection system to
                  the second tower at Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge. The system protects the tie bars and cramps

                <h2>Thermal and Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL has recently commissioned a large scanner system, installed alongside new water cannons, for a
                  large supercritical power generation boiler at Yeungheung power plant, S. Korea. Yeungheung is a
                  modern generation plant with a total generation capacity of about 5GW and feeds power directly into
                  the country's capital Seoul. The scanner and water cannons form a complete feedback control cleaning
                  system for all four walls of the Unit 3 boiler. This is the second scanner system to be installed at
                  this plant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scanner system comprises four sensor arrays, one for each wall, with a total of about 190 sensor
                  locations. Thermal scans of all four walls are completed in around 100 seconds, providing real-time
                  information of tube wall heat flux and wall cleanliness to the cannon cleaning system and this
                  information determines when, where and how the tube wall surfaces are cleaned using the water cannons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As well as providing tube wall thermal data, this scanner is also configured to monitor fireside tube
                  wall corrosion. This achieved by interleaving thermal scans with resistance (i.e. corrosion-related)
                  measurements.

                <h2>Thermal and Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h2>
                <p>
                  RTL have now released their <strong><a href="monitoring.html#tab_hfc">new Heat Flux and Corrosion (HFC) monitors</a></strong>.
                  These monitors use new measurement techniques developed from RTL's established electrical resistance
                  techniques. Electrical signals are applied through heat exchanger tube walls or heat transfer
                  surfaces, using external (cold-side) sensors, to provide a <strong>non-intrusive</strong> measurement
                  of heat flux. HFC monitors are significantly cheaper to install than currently available intrusive
                  heat flux monitors and do not require sensors to be welded into the fireside (hot-side) walls, with
                  all the risks that this process entails.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These systems also have inherent corrosion detection capability and can be used as stand-alone
                  corrosion monitors in their own right. HFC monitors are now available off-the-shelf to be installed
                  and operated directly by clients. Contact the company for further details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL now also produces a range of smaller scanner systems: these <strong><a href="pdf/brochure/mini_scanner_brochure.pdf" target="_blank">new 'mini-scanners'</a></strong>
                  have on-board computing power and operate from a single small enclosure. They are designed for
                  monitoring smaller, more localised areas of boiler wall with up to 50 or more sensor locations, as
                  compared to our larger scanner systems that can handle 500 or more sensor locations. They have similar
                  corrosion and thermal monitoring capabilities as the larger scanners and their compact, self-contained
                  design helps make installation a simple and straight-forward process.

                <p>
                  RTL have designed extended-length variable temperature electrical resistance (VTER) probes for the
                  on-line measurement of corrosion of reheater/superheater tubes in power stations. These probes have
                  the capability of operating two metres inside boilers using a protective ceramic bandage to minimise
                  the temperatures of the probe bodies. Two of these extended VTER probes have recently been installed
                  at Drax Power Station, UK, for the monitoring of 1% chrome tubing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL have now received an order to update the original corrosion scanner on Unit 1 at Drax power
                  station and to add a further four VTER superheater probes and an extended VTER reheater probe.

                <p>
                  RTL have just shipped another full thermal and corrosion scanner to South Korea. This is the sixth
                  scanner to be installed in this country and the second on this modern 'supercritical powered' station
                  that provides electricity for the capital, Seoul. The scanner comes complete with the latest
                  monitoring software and analysis package which sends on-line thermal and corrosion data to the plant
                  control room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A thermal only scanner extension has been supplied to Drax power station for their Unit 4 boiler. This
                  greatly increases the capability of the existing thermal scanner so that combustion conditions that
                  result in tube rupture can be successfully monitored and eventually overcome.

                  The stand-alone non-intrusive heat flux and corrosion monitors are now in their final stage of
                  development. The first production boards are being produced and these should be ready for full testing
                  in a power station in September. These new computer controlled stand-alone monitoring systems have
                  application in many other areas apart from combustion systems, such as pipelines, vessels and
                  industrial plant where there is a risk from corrosion.

                  tower in Shropshire and to 18th century muses at Seaton Delaval Hall – a National Trust property.  The
                  church bellcote contains a wrought iron ring beam embedded in the masonry and also iron cores to the

                  six muses with wrought iron armatures, all of which have been suffering from ongoing corrosion which
                  had cracked and delaminated the plaster/lime bodies and limbs of the sculptures.  This is the first
                  time that RTL have applied cathodic protection to plaster and lime statues.

                  RTL has recently completed a contract to design, supply and install a full corrosion scanner on a
                  fifth South Korea coal-fired boiler - the third boiler to incorporate a scanner system at this
                  particular power station. The system monitors all four boiler walls and incorporates the latest on-
                  line data analysis software which gives both thermal and corrosion rate maps of the boiler walls. The
                  company has also received an order for another corrosion scanner on a Korean supercritical boiler
                  which will be delivered in April 2014. This system will be interfaced with water cannons to create an
                  intelligent wall cleaning system.

                  against the existing intrusive heat flux probes which are used to activate soot blower and water
                  cannon operations. These devices should be commercially available in spring 2014.

                  RTL have recently completed a contract to supply a full corrosion scanner to the sidewalls of the Unit
                  6 boiler at Drax Power Station – the third Drax boiler to be fully instrumented with a corrosion
                  monitoring system installed on the sidewalls. The coal-fired boilers are increasingly having lower-
                  NOx systems installed which results in increasingly 'reducing conditions' within the combustion zones.
                  This can result in high levels of corrosion so careful control of the stoichiometry is essential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company has now automated the corrosion rate analysis package and on-line corrosion rate, metal
                  loss and remaining thickness maps are continually being output from the data loggers. The thermal and
                  corrosion rate data is fed back to the OIS via a fibre optic link so that the boiler operators have
                  direct access to the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RTL have also installed a fast thermal scanner on a section of the back wall of the Unit 4 boiler.
                  This area has increasingly suffered from localised thermal tube damage which have resulted in
                  unscheduled outages. The non-intrusive sensors are used to give estimated fireside information (front
                  face temperatures and heat flux values) and this is allowing the engineers to investigate when (and
                  how) these transient conditions occur.

                <p>
                  The company has recently been awarded another contract in Korea – to supply a full corrosion scanner
                  to the Unit 3 boiler at Samcheonpo Power Station. This is the third boiler to be fitted out at this
                  site.

                  RTL successfully completed a corrosion monitoring programme during biofuel trials carried out on the
                  Unit 1 boiler at Drax Power station in 2011/12. The ground breaking work involved monitoring both the
                  corrosion of the carbon steel furnace walls and also localised attack of the austenitic stainless
                  steel used for the superheaters and reheaters of the 660MW boiler. The high level of alkaline metals
                  in some of the biofuels can result in substantial corrosion of stainless steels, and this was
                  confirmed when some of the worst fuels were combusted and corrosion rates recorded unacceptable
                  levels. The on-line monitoring allowed corrosion rates to be confirmed within around 24 hours.

                  RTL has subsequently been asked to provide a complete monitoring package for the Unit 2 boiler which
                  will be converted to 100% biofuel firing in March 2013. The corrosion scanner system will be the
                  largest ever produced by the company and will take measurements for the full height of both sidewalls
                  and with four superheater probes in the convective section to monitor the corrosion of both T11 and
                  stainless steel Esshete 1250 alloy. The intention is that the boiler feed will initially be wood
                  pellets, but it is possible that more corrosive fuels, such as agro-crops, may be fired later on.  The
                  outputs, comprising corrosion rates, metal loss, remaining metal thickness and heat flux values will
                  be output to the DCS so that the boiler operators will have direct access to the information and can
                  then take appropriate actions on boiler feed and combustion operation.

                <p>
                  Three of the latest versions of our non-intrusive thermal and corrosion scanner systems are currently being
                  installed on coal-fired power station boilers in South Korea. The latest scanner systems monitor both heat
                  flux and corrosion on all four walls of these large boilers with real-time outputs (2D maps) being sent
                  directly to the control rooms and also to the PI historian. The scanner will enable the power stations to
                  optimise their combustion conditions and also allow lower quality coal to be fired in the safe knowledge
                  that damage to the boilers is kept to a minimum.
