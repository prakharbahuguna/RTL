          <h2>Ceramic Thermocouples </h2>
          <p>
            Rowan Technologies has been working on the development of ceramic-based thermocouples (CTs) - both legs of
            the thermocouples are fabricated from ceramics as compared with metals for conventional thermocouple
            sensors. These are capable of measuring temperatures in excess of 1600Â°C in aggressive gaseous and molten
            environments for extended periods and to a high degree of accuracy. The thermocouple technology was
            originally developed by Rowan Technologies Ltd in the 1990s.
          </p>

          <h4>Future Work</h4>
          <p>
            To achieve accuracies as good as existing metallic thermocouples, further work is still required to optimise
            the electrical consistency of the ceramic materials. This may well require some degree of collaboration with
            relevant ceramic manufacturers.
          </p>

          <p>
            For thin-coating thermocouples (for gas turbine application), although some preliminary tests have already
            taken place, further fundamental research is still needed on the electrical behaviour of the ceramic
            coatings before field tests can begin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rowan Technologies is looking for collaborators to fund the commercial development of the ceramic
            thermocouples and to exploit its market potential. Further information can be obtained by contacting Dr.
            David Farrell at <a class="email">znvy@ebjnagrpuabybtvrf.pb.hx</a>.

          <h2>Remote Sacrificial Anodes</h2>
          <p>
            Rowan Technologies developed remote sacrificial anodes (RSAs) for cathodic protection systems in 2002.  The
            RSAs (magnesium or zinc) are buried in the ground away from the structure to be protected and the current is
            carried by copper cables to where it is required. RSAs can be coupled in series to increase the driving
            voltage to the embedded CP system. These have been successfully used on embedded iron in stonework (e.g.
            Inigo Jones Gateway, London) and steel reinforcements in concrete (e.g. the Listening Mirrors, Kent).
