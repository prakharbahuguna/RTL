          <p>
            RTL have now released their <strong>new active heat flux (AHF) and corrosion rate monitors</strong>. These
            monitors use new measurement techniques developed from RTL's established electrical resistance techniques.
            AHF monitors are significantly cheaper to install than currently available intrusive heat flux monitors and
            do not require sensors to be welded into the fireside (hot-side) walls, with all the risks that this process
            entails.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also introduced this year are our <strong>new 'mini-scanner' systems</strong>. These have all the
            capabilities of our larger scanners but are designed for smaller monitoring areas with up to 50 or more
            sensor locations. All the electronics and computer hardware are housed in a single small enclosure, powered
            by a single low-voltage DC supply.
          </p>

          <p>
            RTL have designed extended-length variable temperature electrical resistance (VTER) probes for the on-line
            measurement of corrosion of reheater/superheater tubes in power stations. These probes have the capability
            of operating two metres inside boilers using a protective ceramic bandage to minimise the temperatures of
            the probe bodies. Two of these extended VTER probes have recently been installed at Drax Power Station, UK,
            for the monitoring of 1% chrome tubing.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have recently completed four cathodic protection systems at Lincoln Castle; installed to protect cast
            iron windows from ongoing corrosion. Lincoln's copy of the Magna Carta (one of only four in existence) is
            due to be returned to the city in April and will be installed within the castle. RTL has recently completed
            smaller investigative projects at Hurst Castle and in Hyde Park.

          <h2>Industrial Monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            We design and supply a range of systems for monitoring both the integrity (corrosion, erosion and cracking)
            and thermal behaviour of industrial plants. Our scanner technology, designed to monitor and map large areas
            of plant such as boiler walls, has been used in power generation plant since 1999. New in 2015,
            'mini-scanners' now complement these larger systems and are designed for smaller monitoring areas. Also
            introduced in 2015 are our new heat flux monitors, designed for precision monitoring at point locations.

          <h2>Protection &amp; Conservation</h2>
          <p>
            We provide services and systems for corrosion risk assessment, prevention and control, and specialise in the
            design and supply of cathodic protection systems to inhibit the corrosion of embedded metalwork in masonry
            and concrete. As advisers to English Heritage, we have extensive experience in the preservation and
            conservation of historic structures, including some of the UK’s best known buildings.

          <h2>Services and R&amp;D</h2>
          <p>
            Services include consultancy, failure analysis and environmental monitoring and we have (or have access to)
            a wide range of analytical instrumentation, measurement and test facilities. We have received a number of
            technical awards for our research and development activities: our development projects include ceramic
            thermocouples, ideally suited to high temperature (greater than 1500&deg;C) and highly corrosive
            environments.
