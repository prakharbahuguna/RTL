          <h4><a href="monitoring.html#tab_scanner">New Mini-Scanner Systems:</a></h4>
          <p>
            Mini-scanners complement our existing multi-enclosure scanner technology but are designed for smaller
            monitoring areas, providing both corrosion and heat flux monitoring and mapping capabilities. All the
            mini-scanner electronics is housed in a single easy-install enclosure.
          </p>

          <h4><a href="monitoring.html#tab_hfc">New Heat Flux and Corrosion (HFC) Monitors:</a></h4>
          <p>
            These low-cost, stand-alone units are designed for both heat flux and corrosion monitoring at point
            locations on boiler membrane walls and other surfaces. They use the principle of electrical resistance
            measurement to accurately determine the real heat flux and any loss-in-thickness due to corrosion or
            erosion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sensors are simply welded to external tube walls as opposed to intrusive heat flux systems that require tube
            removal and replacement.

          <h2>Latest News</h2>
          <h3>Industrial Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            Work is underway to upgrade a large corrosion and thermal scanner system at Drax Power Station, UK. The
            system, comprising 270 sensor locations, monitors both fireside corrosion of the sidewall tubing and heat
            transfer through the tube walls.
          </p>

          <h3>Cathodic Protection Systems and Conservation</h3>
          <p>
            We have now installed a second cathodic protection system on Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge and are
            currently involved with repairs to the historic fabric of Hurst Castle, Covent Garden and the World Heritage
            Ironbridge.

          <h2>Industrial Monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            We design and supply a range of systems for monitoring both the integrity (corrosion, erosion and cracking)
            and thermal behaviour of industrial plants. Our scanner technology, designed to monitor and map large areas
            of plant such as boiler walls, has been used in power generation plant since 1999. 'Mini-scanners' now
            complement these larger systems and are designed for smaller monitoring areas. New heat flux and corrosion
            monitors are designed for precision monitoring at point locations.

            We provide services and systems for corrosion risk assessment, prevention and control, and specialise in the
            design and supply of cathodic protection systems to inhibit the corrosion of embedded metalwork in masonry
            and concrete. As advisers to English Heritage, we have extensive experience in the preservation and
            conservation of historic structures, including some of the UK’s best known buildings.
