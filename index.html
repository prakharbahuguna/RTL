          <p>
            RTL have just shipped another full thermal and corrosion scanner to South Korea. This is the sixth scanner
            to be installed in this country and the second on this modern 'supercritical powered' station that provides
            electricity for the capital, Seoul. The scanner comes complete with the latest monitoring software and
            analysis package which sends on-line thermal and corrosion data to the plant control room.
          </p>

          <p>
            A thermal only scanner extension has been supplied to Drax power station for their Unit 4 boiler. This
            greatly increases the capability of the existing thermal scanner so that combustion conditions that result
            in tube rupture can be successfully monitored and eventually overcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            RTL have recently completed the design and installation of cathodic protection systems to a church tower in
            Shropshire and to 18th century muses at Seaton Delaval Hall – a National Trust property. Seaton Delaval Hall
            contains six muses with wrought iron armatures, all of which have been suffering from ongoing corrosion
            which had cracked and delaminated the plaster/lime bodies and limbs of the sculptures. This is the first
            time that RTL have applied cathodic protection to plaster and lime statues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rowan Technologies has recently been awarded a patent for the Electrical Resistance Measurement Systems
            which provide the foundations for both the Thermal and Corrosion Monitoring Scanners.

          <h2>Industrial Monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            We design and supply systems for monitoring both the integrity (corrosion, erosion and cracking) and thermal
            behaviour of industrial plants. Our scanner technology, designed to monitor and map large areas of plant
            such as boiler walls, has been used in power generation plant since 1999 - our first full-scale system is
            now set to have an operational life of more than ten years.

          <p>
            We provide services and systems for corrosion risk assessment, prevention and control, and specialise in the
            design and supply of cathodic protection systems to inhibit the corrosion of embedded metalwork in masonry
            and concrete. As advisers to English Heritage, we have extensive experience in the preservation and
            conservation of historic structures, including some of the UK’s best known buildings.

            technical awards for our research and development activities: our development projects include ceramic
            thermocouples, ideally suited to high temperature (greater than 1500&deg;C) and highly corrosive
            environments.
