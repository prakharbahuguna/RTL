                These stand-alone units are designed for heat flux and corrosion monitoring at point locations on boiler
                membrane walls and other industrial applications. They use the principle of electrical resistance
                measurement to accurately determine the real heat flux and any loss-in-thickness (corrosion or erosion) of
                heat transfer surfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-intrusive</strong> sensors are simply welded to external tube walls as opposed to <strong>intrusive</strong> heat flux probes which require tube removal and replacement.
              </p>
              <p>Straight-forward installation, multiple interface options with plant information systems.</p>

          <h3>Thermal and Corrosion Monitoring Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Two of RTL's new monitoring systems have now been installed on a sub-critical biofuel boiler at Drax, UK.
            These particular systems combine the capabilities of the <strong><a href="monitoring.html#tab_ahf">new
            active heat flux (AHF) monitors</a></strong> and <strong><a href="monitoring.html#tab_ahf">mini-scanner
            systems</a></strong> so providing both multi-point heat flux and corrosion monitoring. These systems form
            part of an upgrade to an existing scanner system that was originally commissioned in 2001. A further AHF
            monitor has been supplied for use on a supercritical boiler in Texas, USA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upgrades to the biofuel boiler at Drax included the installation of five air-cooled VTER probes for
            monitoring the corrosion rates of the superheater and reheater tubing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Commissioning of a thermal and corrosion scanner system for an 800 MW supercritical boiler at Yeungheung
            power plant, South Korea, is soon to get underway.
          </p>

          <h3>Cathodic Protection Systems and Conservation</h3>
          <p>
            Cathodic protection systems have recently been installed to protect iron ring beams, tie bars and iron
            cramps on a large spire at St. Michael’s church in the centre of Bath and also on Brunel’s Clifton
            Suspension Bridge, Bristol.

          <h2>Industrial Monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            We design and supply a range of systems for monitoring both the integrity (corrosion, erosion and cracking)
            and thermal behaviour of industrial plants. Our scanner technology, designed to monitor and map large areas
            of plant such as boiler walls, has been used in power generation plant since 1999. New in 2015,
            'mini-scanners' now complement these larger systems and are designed for smaller monitoring areas. Also
            introduced in 2015 are our new heat flux monitors, designed for precision monitoring at point locations.
