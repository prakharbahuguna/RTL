              <h1>Scanner Systems</h1>
              <p>
                Rowan Technologies' patented scanner systems have online monitoring and mapping capabilities, tailored
                for both low and high temperature industrial plant, including power generation and incineration
                boilers. These include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Corrosion, erosion and crack monitoring</li>
                <li>Heat flux and fireside tube wall temperatures</li>
                <li>Tube wall slagging, fouling and cleaning</li>
                <li>Identifying damaging temperature-related tube wall
                    conditions e.g. boiler flame impingement.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The systems use arrays of sensors, directly attached to external plant surfaces, and are capable of
                mapping large areas, or be used for monitoring smaller, localised areas. They are non-intrusive, as the
                item of plant itself becomes the 'sensor', avoiding the requirement for probe entry ports or tube
                removal, especially important where pressure vessels are concerned.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first scanner system was installed in 1999. Our longest-serving system was installed in 2001 and is
                now set to continue monitoring until at least 2013, a testament to the system's long-term reliability.
              </p>

              <p>
                Systems are available for dedicated thermal monitoring or for corrosion, erosion, crack monitoring (with
                in-built thermal monitoring capability).
              </p>

              <p>
                As well as fixed systems for continuous monitoring, portable systems are also available for periodic
                measurements. For our fixed scanner technology, we can supply small evaluation systems that can be
                extended at a later date to monitor much larger areas.
              </p>

              <h1>Corrosion Probe Systems</h1>
              <p>
                Our range of probe systems for industrial and boiler plant provide information on corrosion/erosion
                rates at specific locations. Our VTER probe technology ultimately led to the development of our scanner
                systems, above.
              </p>

              <p>
                Corrosion probes are available with temperature controlled corrosion elements. Air cooling is used to
                accurately control the element temperatures.
              </p>

              <h1>Incineration and Waste Recovery Boilers</h1>
              <p>
                Systems are also available for incineration and waste recovery boilers to detect and monitor the
                build-up of waste slag on the boiler walls through the use of our thermal monitoring technology. The
                rate of corrosion can also be measured in tandem. These images of a metals recovery boiler were taken
                at the same time as the thermal data was recorded.

              <h1>NTScan&#8482; Thermal Scanner Systems</h1>
              <p>
                The thermal monitoring capabilities of the scanner systems, originally developed for use with our
                corrosion/erosion scanner systems, have been refined to create systems for dedicated thermal monitoring.
                These systems are specifically tailored to high heat flux applications such as power plant and
                waste incinerator boiler walls. Systems are currently in operation on both sub-critical and
                supercritical boilers in Europe, North America and Asia.
              </p>

              <p>
                As with all our scanner systems, they are non-intrusive: a matrix of sensors, welded to external
                surfaces, can be used to produce 2-dimensional maps of the surface's thermal characteristics. In the
                case of boiler membrane walls, these characteristics might be heat flux or fireside tube crown
                temperatures - these parameters being derived from measured external surface temperatures.
              </p>

              <img src="img/diagrams/ml_electrodes_and_map.jpg" width="500" height="177" alt="ML lectrodes and thermal map">

              <p>
                The systems allow easy interfacing with plant information systems and a dedicated software package
                allows data to be retrieved, analysed and displayed in a variety of ways, either for historical data or
                in real time (for example from a control room).
              </p>

              <h2>The thermal mapping technology provides:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Real-time monitoring and mapping - tailored for high heat flux applications such as boiler walls and
                  furnaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mapping of external surface temperatures, estimates of heat flux and fireside tube temperatures,
                  providing information on slagging behaviour, flame impingement, effectiveness of wall cleaning,
                  excessive tube temperatures etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fireside data that can be linked to boiler operations, enabling combustion conditions to be optimised
                  leading to improved thermal efficiencies. Data may be used to control intelligent soot-blowing
                  systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Identification of excessive tube wall temperatures and thermal cycling - and so aids quantification of
                  tube stresses and helps pinpoint underlying causes of tube damage and possible failure.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>System features</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-intrusive technology capable of mapping large areas - electrodes are welded to external surfaces
                  to form rectangular matrices, linear arrays or can be used at individual locations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Interface to plant information systems for data storage and retrieval. Dedicated software allows data
                  analysis and presentation in a multitude of ways - historical, real time, linear traces and 2-D plots.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Re-designed hardware permits quick and easy installation. 'Chains' of assembled units, linked by
                  flexible conduit with pre-installed wiring, are shipped to site for simple, direct mounting. This
                  eliminates almost all on-site wiring and the need for fixed conduit or trunking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Custom-built electrode sensor assemblies - easy to attach. Robust and simple connections to system
                  wiring. Two sensors at each location (membrane and crown) allow estimation of heat flux and fireside
                  tube temperatures. One or two intrusive heat flux sensors within each monitoring area to aid system
                  calibration.
                </li>
                <li>Systems can be readily removed for boiler maintenance.</li>

              <h2>Demonstration Videos</h2>
              <p>
                Thermal maps can be combined in chronological sequence to create videos which can be useful both for
                presenting an overview of thermal variations and also for highlighting more subtle changes within the
                monitoring areas. The videos below are example compilations from the thermal scanner system's 2D map
                sequences. These maps can be produced and viewed in real time or stored and viewed retrospectively by
                the plant historian.

              <h1>Corrosion, Erosion and Crack Monitoring Systems</h1>
              <p>
                These high-accuracy systems have evolved from the well-established electrical resistance technique where
                thinning of a metal increases its measured electrical resistance. However, this measured resistance is
                also temperature dependent and the scanner has the ability to simultaneously measure temperatures and
                resistances to a high precision, allowing this temperature dependency to be effectively nulled out.
              </p>

              <p>
                Measurements are performed at, and between, adjacent sensor locations in a pre-defined sequence (i.e
                sensor arrays are scanned) to allow full surface maps to be produced. The scanners allow parameters such
                as metal loss, corrosion rate, remaining thickness and time-to-replacement to be automatically
                calculated and mapped.
              </p>

              <img src="img/diagrams/tube_wall_and_corrosion.png" width="600" height="218" alt="Tube wall corrosion rate map">

              <p>
                A specialised version of the scanner technology was developed for use on Electric Power Research
                Institute (EPRI) sponsored projects in the USA to help establish the root causes of crack growth on
                weld-overlaid boilers tubes. These systems have been installed on two supercritical power generation
                boilers in Pennsylvania and Texas.
              </p>

              <p>
                The thermal monitoring hardware can operate independently of electrical resistance measurements to
                provide thermal mapping on a real time basis, either as surface temperatures or heat flux. <a
                href="#thermal" class="tabtrigger">Dedicated thermal monitoring systems </a> are available, where plant
                integrity monitoring is not a requirement.
              </p>

              <p>The scanner systems take two forms:</p>

              <h3>Fixed systems for long-term continuous monitoring</h3>
              <p>
                These have a central data logger and control unit, which can be positioned some distance from the
                monitoring area(s), and can handle up to four monitoring areas with a total of over 500 sensor
                locations. These systems were originally developed with the help of UK government funding in the 1990s.
                Fixed systems have been installed on both conventional and FBC boilers for the monitoring of corrosion
                and on two super- critical boilers in the USA, for the monitoring of crack growth on weld-overlaid
                boiler tubes in combination with mapping of the boiler walls' thermal characteristics.<br>

                These have been developed for applications where a fixed system may not be the most appropriate or cost-
                effective means of monitoring. An example may be where there is a requirement for monitoring at a number
                of areas within a chemical complex or oil refinery. Sensors are permanently fixed at each monitoring
                location with associated cabling running back to a small local site box. This arrangement is suitable
                for hazardous areas, as power is only supplied when the portable components are connected, when
                conditions are safe to do so. There is no limit to the number of monitoring areas that may be monitored
                with a single set of portable equipment.<br>

              <h1>ATC&#8482; Systems</h1>
              <p>Rowan Technologies' new Active Thermal and Corrosion (ATC) monitoring systems are small dual-purpose systems for monitoring both tube wall heat flux and fireside tube wall corrosion of boiler membrane walls. The systems are 'active' because they apply signals through the whole tube circumference during the measurement processes.</p>

              <p>These systems have evolved from our scanner technology; included within the ATC systems are refinements of some of the scanner's techniques. ATC systems use a 'focused' approach: all measurements taking place around a small area of tube wall, typically a single tube, as compared to the 'whole wall' approach using rectangular arrays of sensors normally used by the scanners. Just like the scanner sensors, the ATC sensors are welded directly to the cold-side wall surfaces - no access through the boiler wall is required. Our <a href="#overview" class="tabtrigger">overview</a> page summarises the key attributes of both systems.</p>

              <h2>Key Features:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>They are fully autonomous, using an on-board computer for system control, data acquisition and data processing. A separate data logger is not necessary.</li>
                <li>All hardware is contained in single small enclosure, powered by a low-voltage DC supply.</li>
                <li>Thermals and corrosion data can be delivered to plant information systems in a variety of ways: 0-10V, 4-20mA, serial communications or Ethernet.</li>
                <li>The hardware can be connected other ATC enclosures to produce a single larger system that communicates with a central PC (e.g. in a control room) for data analysis and display.</li>
                <li>The ATC hardware can be integrated into scanner systems in the same way as our corrosion probes, to form part of a larger multi-purpose monitoring system.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>In summary, the ATC sensors enhance the range of possibilities from within RTL's monitoring portfolio, which now encompasses single point measurements through to whole wall monitoring. They provide a level of highly-focused monitoring not previously available. The option to install stand-alone units means that installation costs for RTL's monitoring technology can start from an extremely low base.<br>

              <h2>VTER Probe Systems</h2>
              <p>
                Variable Temperature Electrical Resistance (VTER) systems monitor the electrical resistance of a
                corroding elements mounted at the end of temperature-controlled probes, enabling corrosion rates to be
                calculated. The technology is suitable for both short or long term monitoring of corrosion rates in
                industrial and boiler plant.
              </p>

              <p>
                Air cooling is used to control the temperature of the corroding element mounted at the probe end; the
                elements themselves can be a variety of shapes and thicknesses, and includes tubular geometries. As the
                elements thin due to corrosion/erosion, the measured electrical resistance increases.
              </p>

              <p>
                The VTER measurement electronics are extremely sensitive and are able to detect resistance changes as
                small as 50ppm (0.005%) under laboratory conditions. A single VTER systems is able to control up to six
                air-cooled probes.
              </p>

              <p>
                These systems formed the foundations for the development of our electrical resistance scanner
                technology.<br>

              <h2>VTEC Probe Systems</h2>
              <p>
                Designed for aqueous environments, these Variable Temperature Electrochemical system (VTEC) systems use
                a three electrode element which may be air cooled to the same temperature as surrounding surfaces.
              </p>

              <p>
                VTEC systems are suitable for applications where rapid response takes priority over absolute corrosion
                rate measurements and monitor the electrochemical signals produced by the corrosion processes in aqueous
                conditions.
              </p>

              <p>
                A Linear Polarisation Resistance Monitor (LPRM) is used to monitor corrosion rates and can be interfaced
                to a dedicated data logger or plant information systems as required.
              </p>

              <h2>VTC Probes</h2>
              <p>
                Variable Temperature Coupon (VTC) probe systems provide accurate corrosion rates together with
                morphological information at a low cost. These cumulative exposure probes are weighed before and after
                exposure to yield total metal loss information. We can supply a range of tubular and flush fitting
                probes to suit the particular application.
              </p>

              <h2>Probe Temperature Control Systems</h2>
              <p>
                All the above probes incorporate proportional temperature control facilities to air-cool the elements or
                coupons to better than &plusmn;1&deg;C
