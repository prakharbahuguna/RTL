              <h1>Systems Overview</h1>
              <p>
                RTL produces a range of systems for monitoring corrosion/erosion and thermal behaviour of both high and
                low-temperature industrial plant. Primary applications are power generation, incineration and heat
                recovery boilers, however the systems are also suited to other plant such as pipelines and storage
                vessels. We have around twenty years experience in system design and installation and they can be
                tailored to suit individual applications.
              </p>

              <h2>Corrosion and Thermal Scanner Systems</h2>
              <p>
                Our <strong><a href="#scanner" class="tabtrigger">scanner technology</a></strong> is primarily designed
                to directly monitor fireside surface corrosion/erosion and thermal behaviour of boiler walls using
                arrays of sensors welded to external (cold-side) surfaces, allowing monitoring and mapping of large
                areas of wall. The technology is such, however, that it can be applied to a variety of other industrial
                applications, including monitoring of plant where cracking is of concern.
              </p>

              <p>
                Systems capable of monitoring all four walls of the largest power station boilers are supplied as
                multi-enclosure, distributed configurations. More than fifteen such systems have now been installed in
                Europe, N. America and Asia.
              </p>

              <p>
                Smaller single-enclosure systems are also now available. These 'mini-scanners' have on-board computing
                power and operate from a single small enclosure. They are simple to install and are designed for
                monitoring smaller areas of wall.
              </p>

              <h2>Heat Flux and Corrosion (HFC™) Monitors</h2>
              <p>
                <strong><a href="#hfc" class="tabtrigger">HFC monitors</a></strong> are small fully-independent units
                with on-board computing power. They use a 'focused' approach to monitoring: all measurements taking
                place around a small area of tube wall, typically a single tube, as compared to the 'whole wall'
                approach, using rectangular arrays of sensors, normally used by the scanners.
              </p>

              <p>
                They can be used in place of intrusive heat flux probes, so avoiding the complexity, expense and risks
                associated with tube removal.
              </p>

              <p>
                We can also supply systems that combine the benefits of scanners and HFC systems, providing 'the best
                of both worlds' for optimum data quality. These provide flexibility in choosing either point or average
                (i.e. point-to-point) corrosion measurements.
              </p>

              <h2>Corrosion Probes</h2>
              <p>
                Our <strong><a href="#probe" class="tabtrigger">corrosion probes</a></strong> are installed through
                entry ports in the boiler wall and monitor corrosion/erosion by simulating the conditions of normally
                inaccessible internal boiler tubing e.g. superheater and reheater tubing. They can be used as an
                investigative tool to identify when corrosion occurs, for examining the effect of changes in boiler
                operation on corrosion rates or to evaluate the corrosion performance of different alloys. Air cooling
                is used to accurately control the temperature of the probes' corrosion elements to that of the tubing
                under investigation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The schematic below provides an overview of the monitoring options that we can provide for a large power
                generation boiler. All three system types can be interconnected and controlled from a central point.

              <h1>Corrosion and Thermal Scanners</h1>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Our scanner technology is primarily designed to directly monitor fireside surface corrosion/erosion and
                thermal behaviour of boiler walls using arrays of sensors welded to external (cold-side) surfaces,
                allowing monitoring and mapping of large areas of wall. However, the technology can be applied to a
                variety of other industrial applications, including monitoring of plant where cracking is of concern.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><i>Corrosion/erosion scanners, with thermal monitoring capability,</i></strong> are based on
                well-established electrical resistance principles where thinning of a metal increases its measured
                electrical resistance. However, this measured resistance is also temperature-dependent and the scanners
                have the ability to simultaneously measure both temperatures and resistances to a high precision,
                allowing this temperature dependency to be effectively nulled out.
              </p>

              <p>
                Arrays of sensors are welded to external (cold-side) surfaces. Measurements are performed at, and
                between adjacent sensor locations in a pre-defined sequence (i.e sensor arrays are scanned) to allow
                full surface maps to be produced. Resistance measurements between adjacent sensor locations provide an
                average rate of uniform metal loss between those locations. The scanners allow parameters such as metal
                loss, corrosion rate, remaining thickness and time-to-replacement to be automatically calculated and
                mapped.
              </p>

              <p>
                The images below show boiler fireside tube wall corrosion and a corrosion map produced by our very first
                scanner in the late 1990s:
              </p>

              <img src="img/diagrams/tube_wall_and_corrosion.png" width="600" height="218" alt="Tube wall corrosion rate map">

              <p>
                The scanner's thermal monitoring capabilities can be used independently of corrosion/erosion
                measurements to provide thermal mapping on a real time basis, either as surface temperatures or heat
                flux.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><i>Dedicated thermal monitoring scanners</i></strong> are also available, where corrosion
                monitoring is not required. Depending on system configuration, these systems are able to produce thermal
                maps (i.e. heat flux and surface temperatures) from all four wall of a large power station boiler at
                around two-minute intervals. This enables, for example, the effects of wall cleaning to be examined and
                monitored.
              </p>

              <p>
                The images below show typical boiler wall scanner sensor locations and a scanner's thermal map of
                fireside tube wall temperatures following a slag 'avalanche' down the wall of a supercritical boiler,
                immediately exposing a narrow strip of wall to high radiant heat:
              </p>

              <p>
                For continuous monitoring, new single-enclosure <strong><i>'mini-scanner' systems</i></strong> have now
                been added to our range of scanner options. <strong><i>Portable systems</i></strong> are also available
                and, as well as corrosion/erosion monitoring, our scanners have been employed to monitor, and establish
                root causes of, crack growth (see 'Crack Growth' tab).
              </p>


              <h2>Scanner Systems for up to 500 Sensor Locations</h2>
              <p>
                These multi-enclosure systems are capable of monitoring multiple large areas, for example all four wall
                of a power generation boiler. They have a central data logger and control unit, which can be positioned
                some distance from the monitoring area(s). Instrument enclosures, located near the monitoring areas,
                send back sensor information to the data logger. Approximately fifteen such systems are currently
                installed on conventional sub-critical, super-critical and FBC boilers in Europe, Asia and the US.
              </p>

              <p>
               <strong>Corrosion/erosion and thermal monitoring systems</strong> perform continuous corrosion monitoring
               whilst allowing real-time thermal monitoring to be performed between corrosion measurements:

                and waste incinerator boiler walls:

              <h2>Mini-TC Scanners™ for up to 50 Sensor Locations</h2>
              <p>
                These new, fully-independent systems are designed for smaller monitoring areas of up to 50 or more
                sensor locations. Like multi-enclosure systems, mini-scanners are designed for both corrosion and
                thermal monitoring.
              </p>
              <p>
                All electronics are housed in a single enclosure positioned close to the monitoring area, have an
                on-board computer and are powered by a single low-voltage DC supply. This compact, self-contained
                design helps to keep installation costs to an absolute minimum.
              </p>

              <p>
                Systems have optional Ethernet and serial links to remote PCs in control room or office and also
                incorporate 0-10V, 4-20 mA analogue outputs. Multiple systems can be linked to central computer for
                data storage and analysis.

              </ul>


              <h2>Portable Systems for Periodic Monitoring</h2>
              <p>
                These have been developed for applications where continuous monitoring, using permanently-installed
                systems, may not be the most appropriate or cost-effective approach.
              </p>

              <p>
                 An example may be where there is a requirement for monitoring at a number of areas within a chemical
                 complex or oil refinery. Sensors are permanently fixed at each monitoring location with associated
                 cabling running back to a small local site box. This arrangement is suitable for hazardous areas, as
                 power is only supplied when the portable components are connected, when conditions are safe to do so
              </p>

              <p>
                There is no limit to the number of monitoring areas that may be monitored with a single set of portable
                equipment.

              <h2>Crack Growth</h2>
              <p>
                A specialised version of the scanner technology was developed for use on Electric Power Research Institute
                (EPRI) sponsored projects in the USA to help establish the root causes of <strong><a href="#crack"
                class="tabtrigger"> crack growth</a></strong> on weld-overlaid boilers tubes. These systems have been
                installed on two supercritical power generation boilers in Pennsylvania and Texas.

              <h1>HFC&trade; Monitors</h1>
              <p>
                Rowan Technologies' new Heat Flux and Corrosion (HFC) monitors are small dual-purpose systems for
                monitoring both tube wall heat flux and fireside tube wall corrosion of boiler membrane walls.
              </p>

              <p>
                Just like our scanner sensors, the monitor's sensors are welded directly to the cold-side wall surfaces
                - no access through the boiler wall is required.
              </p>

              <p>
                To monitor heat flux, a unique dual-measurement approach is used that combines 'active' measurements
                that pass signals around the whole tube circumference, including the fireside front face, with 'passive'
                surface measurements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Alongside heat flux, HFC monitors are able to simultaneously monitor tube wall corrosion using the same
                method developed for our scanner technology. However, unlike the scanners, HFC monitors use a 'focused'
                approach: all measurements taking place around a small area of tube wall, typically a single tube, as
                compared to the 'whole wall' approach, using rectangular arrays of sensors, normally used by the
                scanners.
              </p>

              <p>
                All electronics is housed in a small fully self-contained enclosure, powered from a low voltage DC
                supply. This, combined with their external wall sensors, makes these monitors an easy-install,
                cost-effective choice.
              </p>

              <p>The key features of the HFC monitors are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Like the scanners, sensors are welded to external (cold-side) tube wall surfaces.</li>
                <li>'Focused' single-point monitoring of heat flux and corrosion/erosion, typically at a single tube.
                </li>
                <li>They use a unique dual-measurement approach to monitor heat flux.</li>
                <li>They are fully self-contained, using an on-board computer for system control, data acquisition and
                data processing. A separate data logger is not necessary.</li>
                <li>All hardware is housed in single small enclosure, powered by a low-voltage DC supply.</li>
                <li>Easy installation, with no wall intervention other than welding to external surfaces.</li>
                <li>A single unit can monitor up to two point locations. </li>
                <li>Thermal and corrosion data can be delivered to plant information systems in a variety of ways:
                0-10V, 4-20mA, serial communications or Ethernet.</li>
                <li>Monitors can be inter-connected to produce a single larger system that communicates with a central
                PC (e.g. in a control room) for data analysis and display.</li>
                <li>They can be integrated into scanner systems in the same way as our corrosion probes, to form part of
                a larger multi-purpose monitoring system.</li>
              </ul>

              <h1>Corrosion Probes</h1>
              <h2>VTER Probe Systems</h2>
              <p>
                Variable Temperature Electrical Resistance (VTER) systems monitor the electrical resistance of corroding
                elements mounted at the end of temperature-controlled probes, enabling corrosion rates to be calculated.
                The technology is suitable for both short or long term monitoring of corrosion rates in industrial and
                boiler plants.
              </p>

              <p>
                Air cooling is used to control the temperature of the corroding element mounted at the probe end; the
                elements themselves can be a variety of shapes and thicknesses, and includes tubular geometries. As the
                elements thin due to corrosion/erosion, the measured electrical resistance increases.
              </p>

              <p>
                The VTER measurement electronics are extremely sensitive and are able to detect resistance changes as
                small as 50ppm (0.005%) under laboratory conditions. A single VTER system is able to control up to six
                air-cooled probes.
              </p>

              <p>
                These systems formed the foundations for the development of our electrical resistance scanner
                technology.<br>

              <h2>VTEC Probe Systems</h2>
              <p>
                Designed for aqueous environments, these Variable Temperature Electrochemical (VTEC) systems use a three
                electrode element which may be air cooled to the same temperature as surrounding surfaces.
              </p>

              <p>
                VTEC systems are suitable for applications where rapid response takes priority over absolute corrosion
                rate measurements and monitor the electrochemical signals produced by the corrosion processes in aqueous
                conditions.
              </p>

              <p>
                A Linear Polarisation Resistance Monitor (LPRM) is used to monitor corrosion rates and can be interfaced
                to a dedicated data logger or plant information system as required.
              </p>

              <h2>VTC Probes</h2>
              <p>
                Variable Temperature Coupon (VTC) probe systems provide accurate corrosion rates together with
                morphological information at a low cost. These cumulative exposure probes are weighed before and after
                exposure to yield total metal loss information. We can supply a range of tubular and flush fitting
                probes to suit specific applications.
              </p>

              <h2>Probe Temperature Control Systems</h2>
              <p>
                All the above probes incorporate proportional temperature control hardware to air-cool the elements or
                coupons to better than &plusmn;1&deg;C

              <h1>Crack Growth</h1>
              <p>
                Rowan Technologies scanner systems can be used for monitoring and establishing the root causes of crack
                growth:
              </p>

              <p>
                The scanners use the in-built electrical resistance measurement approach to monitor crack propagation.
                Changes in measured signals, as a consequence of crack growth, can be relatively small, particularly in
                early stages of crack initiation and so monitoring growth can be challenging in some circumstances.
                However, as cracks deepen, changes in measured resistance values increase and so become easier to
                quantify.
              </p>

              <p>
                The scanners added ability to monitor thermal behaviour enables it to provide insights into the possible
                root causes of cracking.
              </p>

              <p>Please contact Rowan Technologies to discuss possible applications.</p>


              <h3>Case Study: Circumferential Crack Growth – Supercritical Power Generation Boiler.</h3>

              <p>
                This case study describes an EPRI-funded project that took place on a US supercritical power generation
                boiler (2006-9) where a scanner system was installed to help establish the root causes of
                circumferential cracking on the fireside tube walls:
              </p>

              <p>
                Brunner Island Unit 3 is an 800MW coal-fired supercritical unit. Like many supercritical units, the
                boiler is prone to circumferential cracking of the fireside tube walls under particular operating
                regimes. Plant modifications to reduce NOx emissions, together with the introduction of tube weld
                overlay to inhibit corrosion, resulted in a greater prevalence of this type of cracking.
              </p>

              <p>
                Wall cracking is thought to have a number of causal factors including high wall temperatures, large tube
                wall temperature differences and corrosion fatigue. Although cracks were initially superficial in
                nature, severe cracking of the tube walls at Brunner Island had resulted in a number of tube leaks and
                subsequent unscheduled shut downs for repair.
              </p>

              <p>
                As part of the EPRI project, a scanner system was installed on Unit 3 to monitor areas of both front and
                side wall that had previously suffered tube wall cracking. Roughly 170 sensor locations were installed
                to cover some 150 sq. meters of tube wall. This unit was one of two supercritical units in the US to
                have scanner systems installed as part of this project.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Brunner Island installation provided the first scanner field trial for circumferential crack growth
                monitoring and a combination of small signal changes and some inevitable background 'noise' made this
                task significantly more challenging than on-site monitoring of corrosion.
              </p>

              <p>
                More crucially, the system helped identify the thermally-related root causes of the cracking phenomena
                so that appropriate action can be taken to minimise or eliminate it completely. Because cracking is
                partly attributable to high and variable tube wall temperatures, monitoring and analysis of the walls'
                thermal characteristics formed a critical part of this project.
              </p>

              <p>
                The scanner provided a wealth of thermal data to help understand the underlying causes. To ensure
                adequate data sampling, the scanner typically performed a thermal scan cycle at a rate of roughly 200
                sensors every minute, enabling rapid thermal transients to be captured and analysed. Data was sent
                directly to the plant historian, allowing immediate data processing and presentation in the form of 2D
                maps and real-time traces from each sensor.
              </p>

              <p>
                The scanner's ability to 'see the whole picture' allowed previously unseen phenomena to be visualised
                for the first time. These included the real-time thermal impact of mechanical wall cleaning, the nature
                of natural slag shedding and identification of likely flame impingement. All these phenomena are
                possible contributory factors to wall cracking. Maps could be compiled into video sequences; as well as
                having obvious visual appeal, these help to interpret more subtle time-dependant behaviour. Using
                another investigative approach, time-dependant traces from individual scanner sensor locations could be
                correlated with boiler operations to help understand the dynamics of the wall's thermal behaviour.
              </p>

              <p>
                Following the initial findings of the research project, the plant made operational changes to tackle the
                cracking problem on this unit. These seemed to have the desired effects, resulting in reduced down time
                together with improved performance.
